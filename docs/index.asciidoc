[[introduction]]
== Introduction

The {marketplace}[Microsoft Azure Marketplace] solution is a preconfigured
template to deploy an Elasticsearch cluster and Kibana to Azure.

The solution provides a UI within the {portal}[Azure portal] that guides you through a
series of steps in which you provide the minimum number of input parameters needed
to deploy a cluster. After the last step, the UI feeds the provided parameter
values to an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template which deploys the requested
Azure resources to a resource group. In a matter of minutes, you have a cluster!

The {github}[ARM template] that the Marketplace offering uses for deploying
resources can be used independently and from outside of the Azure portal using
{azurecli}[Azure CLI] or {azurepowershell}[Azure PowerShell] command line tools.
