= Deploying with Azure Marketplace and Resource Manager (ARM) template

[[azure-marketplace-arm-template-introduction]]
== Introduction

The {marketplace}[Microsoft Azure Marketplace] solution is a preconfigured
template to deploy an Elasticsearch cluster, Kibana, and Logstash to Azure.

The solution provides a UI within the {portal}[Azure portal] that guides you through a
series of steps in which you provide the minimum number of input parameters needed
to deploy an Elasticsearch cluster to Azure. Following the last step,
the UI feeds the provided parameter values to an <<azure-arm-template, Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
template>> which deploys the requested Azure resources to a resource group, and,
in a matter of minutes, you have a running cluster!

The {github}[ARM template] used by the Marketplace offering for deploying
resources can be used independently from and outside of the Azure portal using
{azurecli}[Azure CLI] or {azurepowershell}[Azure PowerShell] command line tools.

Read on to see how to use either to get a cluster up and running on Azure.
