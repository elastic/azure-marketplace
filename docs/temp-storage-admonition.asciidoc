https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/mast/2013/12/06/understanding-the-temporary-drive-on-windows-azure-virtual-machines/[Temp storage], with filesystem `/dev/sdb1` mounted on `/mnt` in Ubuntu,
is present on the physical machine hosting the VM. It is ephemeral in nature and
not persistent; A VM can move to a different host at _any_ point in time for various
reasons, including hardware failures. When this happens, the VM will be created on
the new host using the OS disk from the storage account, and __new temp storage
will be created on the new host__.

Using temp storage _can_ be a cost effective way of running an
Elasticsearch cluster on Azure with decent performance, _so long_ as you understand
the tradeoffs in doing so, by snapshotting frequently and ensuring adequate data
redundancy through sufficient replica shards.
