Sometimes, things may go wrong with the deployment for a number of different
reasons including but not limited to

- Incorrect or invalid parameters passed to the template,
that pass initial validation but fail at deployment time
- Transient errors associated with template dependencies
- Transient errors associated with the Azure infrastructure

When such issues arise, you'll need to know where to look to ascertain what the
underlying problem is, in order to determine what action to take to rectify.

=== Diagnosing through logs



=== Accessing nodes



=== Repeated deployments
