== Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

What resources does the Marketplace deploy?::
+
The default configuration of the Marketplace deploys the following resources:
+
* 1 virtual network
* 3 dedicated master node Standard D1 SKU VMs running Ubuntu 16.04 with OS disks
and network interfaces
* 1 availability set for master nodes
* 3 data node Standard DS1 v2 SKU VMs running Ubuntu 16.04 with OS disks, network
interfaces and one
1024Gb managed disk per data node
* 1 availability set for data nodes
* 1 Kibana Standard D1 SKU VM running Ubuntu 16.04 with OS disk, network interface,
network security group and public IP address
* 1 internal load balancer

+
A 30 day trial license of {xpack}[Elastic's X-Pack] is also installed. X-Pack is available
under {subscriptions}[a commercial license subscription], and extends the stack with features such
as Security, Monitoring, Alerting, Reporting, Graph and Machine Learning capabilities.
+
What is the cost of the Azure Marketplace solution?::
The cost of deploying from the Marketplace will vary depending on the cluster
topology that you decide to deploy and the VM SKUs that you choose for each of the
VMs within the cluster. The cost will also vary depending on which Azure region
you decide to deploy to. Because there are a number of variables involved, a cost
needs to be calculated on a case-by-case basis. At a minimum, you will pay for
all Azure resources deployed by the template. The
{azurecalculator}[Azure pricing calculator] can help in providing a good estimate
for this. In addition to the cost of Azure resources, {subscriptions}[X-Pack Gold, Platinum and
Enterprise subscriptions] require a license to be purchased, the cost of which is
dependent on a number of factors. Please get in touch with us to discuss.
+
How do I connect to Elasticsearch?::
Elasticsearch can be accessed from outside of Azure by choosing an external load
balancer for the load balancer type, within the External access blade step.
+
From within Azure, Azure resources can access Elasticsearch by connecting to the
Virtual network in which the cluster is deployed. It is recommended to connect through
the internal load balancer, which will round robin requests to client (coordinating only)
nodes if deployed, or to data nodes otherwise.
+
How do I connect to the VMs to troubleshoot?::
Elasticsearch VMs are not accessible from outside of the virtual network. When
configuring the deployment through the blade steps, a Kibana VM or Jumpbox VM can
be deployed through which all VMs attached to the virtual network can be accessed.
+
Both Kibana and Jumpbox VMs are configured with a network security group that allows
TCP traffic over port 22, to allow you to use SSH to securely connect to VMs. SSH
authentication will use the authentication mechanism specified in the Basics step,
either `password` or `SSH public key`:
+
[source,sh]
----
ssh <admin username>@<kibana or jumpbox public IP address>
----
+
Once connected to the Kibana or Jumpbox VM, other VMs on the virtual network can
be accessed using SSH with either the private IP address or VM hostname (if using
Azure DNS to resolve addresses from hostnames):
+
[source,sh]
----
ssh <admin username>@<internal IP address or VM hostname>
----
+
See the <<troubleshooting, troubleshooting section>> for more details.

Does the Marketplace solution deploy Logstash?::
The Marketplace solution **does not** currently deploy Logstash, only Elasticsearch
and Kibana. There is an {github}/issues/157[open issue] to track and discuss the inclusion of Logstash
within the template.
+
You can deploy Logstash manually by creating a new VM, attaching it to the same
virtual network to which the cluster is attached, and deploy Logstash onto the VM by
using SSH through either the Kibana VM or Jumpbox VM.
