[WARNING]
--
After the trial license period expires, the trial platinum features
{licenseexpiration}[**operate in a degraded mode**].

You should update your license as soon as possible. You are essentially flying blind
when running with an expired license. The license can be updated at any point before
or on expiration, using the {elasticdocs}/update-license.html[Update License API]
or Kibana UI, if available in the version deployed.

With Elasticsearch 6.3+, you can revert to a free perpetual basic license
included with deployment by using the {elasticdocs}/start-basic.html[Start Basic API].

With Elasticsearch 6.2 and prior, you can {register}[register for free basic license] and apply
it to the cluster.
